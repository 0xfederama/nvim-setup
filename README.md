# nvim-setup

This is my nvim setup, made with the help of these resources: 
- [ThePrimeagen setup](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua) and his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE)
- [TJ DeVries kistarting file](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) and his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=stqUbv-5u2s)

I will keep this repo updated with more plugins and settings as I use them.
